## Overview

In computer science, LIFO and FIFO are two common data structures used to manage elements in a collection.

- **LIFO (Last In, First Out):** The last element added is the first one to be removed.
- **FIFO (First In, First Out):** The first element added is the first one to be removed.

This project provides simple implementations of both LIFO and FIFO data structures.

## Features

- Basic LIFO and FIFO operations.
- Easy-to-understand code.
- Modifiable and extensible for specific use cases.
